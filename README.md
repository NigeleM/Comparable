# Comparable
Compares records against records in another csv file. Creates a Match file of all records that match from the first file. 

1. Use Cases
I do alot of comparing information in excel, It is easier to run a script when you have alot of data.
The beautiful thing about this script/program is that i can adjust the program to compare against any file.
I can adjust the columns as needed. 

# How it works
Pass in the column numbers you want to compare against in each file.
Example '1 2 4', '2 9 7' . column 1 in file1 will be compared with column 2 in file2, 2 against 9 and 4 against 7.
